    # Filter type: "none", "statistical", "radius", or "cascaded"
    # - "none": No filtering, passthrough mode (useful for testing/comparison)
    # - "statistical": Good for removing points in sparse regions (such as far edges)
    # - "radius": Better for removing isolated floating artifacts while keeping valid edges
    # - "cascaded": Applies radius filtering first, then statistical (most aggressive, ~2x slower)
    filter_type: "radius"

    # Statistical Outlier Removal (SOR) parameters
    # Removes points whose mean distance to K neighbors exceeds a threshold
    sor_mean_k: 50 # Number of nearest neighbors to analyze for each point
    sor_stddev_mul: 2.0 # Standard deviation multiplier threshold

    # Radius Outlier Removal (ROR) parameters
    # Removes points that have fewer than min_neighbors within the search radius
    ror_radius: 0.5 # Search radius in meters (adjust based on point density)
    ror_min_neighbors: 2 # Minimum neighbors required within radius
